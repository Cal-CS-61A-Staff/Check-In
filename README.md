Lab Assistant Manager
============

## Overview

Provides a web-based interface for managing lab assistants. Allows TAs to configure seections for lab assistants to sign up for along with facilitating the check in process.

## Branch Organization:
* ***master*** - is the main branch, storing the current code all non-course specific features should be branched from.
* ***cs61a*** - is the master branch for the CS61A course lab assistant manager instance.
* ***cs61b*** - is the master branch for the CS61B course lab assistant manager instance.
* ***data8*** - is the master branch for the DATA8 course lab assistant manager instance.

## How to contribute:
* Fork the repository. If you are not used to github have a look at [fork a repository](https://help.github.com/fork-a-repo)
* Create a branch either from master (or a specific course branch if this is a 1 course only feature).
* Add your features and commit your desired changes.
* Create a pull request detailing your changes [creating pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

## Installation

1. Set up VirtualBox, Vagrant & Homestead

    Download and install virtual box:
    https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

    Download and install vagrant:
    https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html

    Install the Homestead Vagrant Box:
    `vagrant box add laravel/homestead`

    Install Homestead

    ```
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/laravel/homestead.git Homestead
    # Clone the desired release...
    git checkout v6.1.0

    # If on Mac / Linux...
    bash init.sh

    # If on Windows...
    init.bat
    ```

    Update `Homestead.yaml` to point to where you are cloning this repo. E.g:

    ```
    folders:
        - map: ~/Projects/Check-In
          to: /home/vagrant/Code/Check-In

    sites:
        - map: la.local
          to: /home/vagrant/Code/Check-In/public
          php: "5.6"
    ```

    Append the following lines to `after.sh`:

    ```
    # Install MySQL Server, PHP 5.6 and required packages
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install -y mysql-server php5.6-common php5.6-cli php5.6-curl php5.6-fpm php5.6-mbstring php5.6-mcrypt php5.6-mysql php5.6-xml

    # Use PHP5.6 as system default PHP
    sudo update-alternatives --set php $(which php5.6)

    # Change any PHP7 references in Nginx sites
    sudo sed -i -E 's/php7[.0-9]*?/php5.6/g' /etc/nginx/sites-available/*

    # Change PHP5.6 FPM to run under vagrant user (necessary for writing data to Check-In folder)
    sudo sed -i -e 's/www-data/vagrant/g' /etc/php/5.6/fpm/pool.d/www.conf

    # Reload config changes
    sudo service nginx restart
    sudo service php5.6-fpm restart
    ```

2. Set up your hosts file

    You must add the "domains" for your Nginx sites to the hosts file on your machine. The hosts file will redirect requests for your Homestead sites into your Homestead machine. On Mac and Linux, this file is located at `/etc/hosts`. On Windows, it is located at `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`. The lines you add to this file will look like the following:

    ```
    192.168.10.10  la.local
    ```

    Make sure the IP address listed is the one set in your Homestead.yaml file. Once you have added the domain to your hosts file and launched the Vagrant box you will be able to access the site via your web browser:

    http://la.local

3. Set up environment variables

    ```
    cd ~/Projects/Check-In
    # Copy the example environment variable file to .env
    cp env.example .env
    # Edit .env as necessary
    vim .env # or with your editor of choice
    ```

4. Start the Vagrant instance

    ```
    cd ~/Homestead
    vagrant up
    ```

5. SSH into the Vagrant instance

    ```
    vagrant ssh
    # Set working directory to project location
    cd ~/Code/Check-In
    ```

6. In SSH: Install dependencies using `composer` (PHP package manager)

    ```
    composer install
    ```

7. In SSH: Run the database migrations

    ```
    php artisan migrate
    ```

8. In SSH: Seed the database with initial values

    ```
    php artisan db:seed --class DefaultSettingsSeeder
    ```

9. In SSH: Generate an application key

    ```
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

10. Write the codestuffs

    Point your browser to http://la.local.

    Edit files in `~/Projects/Check-In` as necessary

11. Stop the VM when you're done working

    ```
    vagrant halt
    ```

## Post-Installation

The next time you want to start working again, simply start the Vagrant instance again

```
vagrant up
```

And stop it when you're done

```
vagrant halt
```

If you change the sites or maps inside of `Homestead.yaml` you will need to run the following to update Vagrant:
```
vagrant reload --provision
```

## Deployment

First point a git remote to the Dokku server (the example below is CS61A specific):

    git remote add dokku dokku@app.cs61a.org:la

To deploy from master:

    git push dokku master

Deploy from another branch:

    git push dokku my_branch:master


### First Time Deployment

Note: These are deployment instructions to the CS61A managed Dokku platform. They should be generic enough to follow to deploy to your own Dokku instance however.

Tip:  add `alias dokku="ssh -t dokku@app.cs61a.org"` to your aliases file (e.g. `~/.bashrc`).

    dokku apps:create app-name
    git remote add online dokku@app.cs61a.org:<app_name>
    dokku mysql:create db-name
    dokku mysql:link db-name app-name
    # Set DNS record
    dokku domains:add app-name name.cs61a.org

    # Get the APP KEY
    dokku enter <app_name> web php artisan key:generate

    dokku config:set app-name APP_KEY=<KEY COPIED FROM key:generate command> APP_ENV=prod OK_COURSE_OFFERING="cal/cs61a/fa17" APP_OAUTH_KEY=<SECRET> APP_URL="https://mydomain.com" FORCE_HTTPS=true MAIL_DRIVER=mailgun MAIL_GUN_DOMAIN=<MAIL_GUN_DOMAIN> MAIL_GUN_SECRET=<MAIL_GUN_SECRET>
    MAIL_HOST=<MAIL_HOST> MAIL_PORT=<MAIL_PORT> MAIL_USERNAME=<MAIL_USERNAME> MAIL_PASSWORD=<MAIL_SECRET> MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null
    dokku letsencrypt app-name
    # Change OK OAuth to support the domain

    # Run migrations after following steps in Deployment
    dokku enter <app_name> web php artisan migrate --force
    dokku enter <app_name> web php artisan db:seed --class=DefaultSettingsSeeder --force
